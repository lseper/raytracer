Implementing multiple process functionality for the raytracer. This requires a standardized scene format. I'm just using JSON and shoving everything
into a scene.json file. This is via the serde serialization crate, which requires I use nightly rust to compile due to some of the dependencies.
to switch back to stable rust, use `rustup default stable`. To switch back to nightly, `rustup default nightly`. To update (as nightly rust updates frequently),
run `rustup update`.
